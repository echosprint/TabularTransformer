    "  - eval_interval=100: The model will be evaluated on the validation set every 100 iterations, allowing you to monitor its performance regularly during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - eval_iters=20: Defines the number of iterations used during the evaluation phase. It helps average the performance over several mini-batches to get a more stable evaluation metric.\n",
