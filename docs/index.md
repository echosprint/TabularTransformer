# TabularTransformer 

## Welcome to TabularTransformerâ€™s documentation!

TabularTransformer is a lightweight, end-to-end deep learning framework built with PyTorch, leveraging the power of the Transformer architecture. It is designed to be scalable and efficient with the following advantages:

- Streamlined workflow with no need for preprocessing or handling missing values.
- Unleashing the power of Transformer on tabular data domain.
- Native GPU support through PyTorch.
- Minimal APIs to get started quickly.
- Capable of handling large-scale data.
